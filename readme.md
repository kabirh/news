Spotify app that display the latest news from the Echo Nest API for the artist that's currently playing. It auto-updates when you advance tracks.

To get this working:
1) Create this folder: ~/Spotify/news
2) Drop these files there
3) Open news.js and add your EN API key to line 48 where it says YOUR_API_KEY
4) Open Spotify
5) Type spotify:app:news in the search field and hit enter

And Voila! Knowledge.

Ignore the commented out code at the end of news.js. I'm working displaying the current artist's FB/Twitter feeds but it's not fully baked yet.
